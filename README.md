# VOLE_translater
A program so that i don't need to use table to look up what VOLE commands mean


## How To Use
If nothing is done to the program, you should be able to just run the main file.

From here you just enter in the line which you need translated.

You will be told if there are any lines that does not follow the rules of the commands. The same goes if you input a line that is'nt divisble by 4.
